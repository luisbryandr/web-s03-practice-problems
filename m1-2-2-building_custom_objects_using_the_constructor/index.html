    PROBLEM 1: Create a constructor function called Person in the below class that takes in two parameters, name and age, and creates a new object with those properties. Create a new instance of Person and call the greet method. Console.log the new Person's greeting to see the results printed to the console.

Add a method to the Team prototype called win that increases the team's number of wins by one. Add another method called loss that increases the team's number of losses by one.

    PROBLEM 4: Write a constructor function called Product that takes in three parameters, name, price, and description, and creates a new object with those properties. Add a method to the Product prototype called discount that takes in a percentage and reduces the price of the product by that percentage. Create a new instance of Product and use the discount method to reduce the price of the product.
